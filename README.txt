To correctly play the game on Windows:
1.  Make sure you download all files and folders in the repository 
and that they are al contained within the same folder.
2.  Open the .exe file.
3.  Choose your resoultion and if you wish to display the game on full
screen or windowed mode.  Press ok and enjoy.

Note:  As of this version the game only has two stages.  Also, 
although attacking enemies appears as an option when pressing
the 'Ctrl', the character will display attack animations but
will have no effect on enemies as this has not been included in this
version.

Hope you enjoy!
